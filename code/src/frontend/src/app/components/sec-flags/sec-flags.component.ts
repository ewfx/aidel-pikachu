    "Credit Loss Provisions: Has the allowance for loan losses increased disproportionately compared to loan growth, signaling potential credit quality issues?",
    "Net Interest Margin (NIM) Trends: Is NIM shrinking, indicating declining profitability due to lower lending rates or higher funding costs?",
    "Efficiency Ratio & Expense Management: Is non-interest expense growing faster than revenue, suggesting operational inefficiencies or excessive legal costs?",
    "Deposit & Liquidity Trends: Are total deposits declining, or is there increased reliance on short-term funding, signaling potential liquidity stress?",
    "Risk Management & Internal Controls: Are there disclosures of weaknesses in internal controls or governance failures that could lead to future compliance breaches?",
    "Executive & Board Stability: Have there been major executive departures, board changes, or unusual insider stock sales that could indicate internal turmoil?",
    "Capital Adequacy & CET1 Ratio: Is Wells Fargoâ€™s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio declining, indicating weakening capital reserves to absorb financial shocks?",
